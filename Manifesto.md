# Manifesto

• **Live honestly** - words and actions are art, use them for transformative purposes </br>
• **Learn** - things are simple, complexity is fractal; identify the building blocks </br>
• **Play** - find fun in solving every problem, enjoy life! </br>

• **Balance carefully** - be careful of excess and deficincy, optimal is often subjective </br>
• **Think Agnosticly** - if knowing creates subjectivity, it thus disrupts balance </br>

**_Apply empirically!_**
