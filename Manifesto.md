# Manifesto

** Live honestly ** - words and actions are art, use them for transformative purposes
** Learn ** - things are simple, complexity is fractal; identify the building blocks
** Play ** - find fun in solving every problem, enjoy life!

** Balance carefully ** - be careful of excess and deficincy, optimal is often subjective
** Think Agnosticly ** - if knowing creates subjectivity, it thus disrupts balance

** _Apply empirically!_ **
